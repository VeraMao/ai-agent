AI Agent Final Repo

## Final Project

Students will work alone or in groups (of up to 4) to perform a substantial AI agent project for social insight based on approaches and tools developed/explored over the course of the quarter. These projects must integrate at least three forms of data in a single model, use at least three types of models (from three separate weeks over the course of the quarter), and must validate inferences or predictions with qualitative interpretation and assessments. These projects are encouraged to be performed in groups (of up to 4 students). Specific datasets or access associated with some possible example projects are described on the following page (make suggestions if you find other valuable data). Please fill out the following form to express your interest in a group project.

### Blog Post

Groups will compose a detailed, entertaining, and informative public-facing Substack or Medium.com blog post about their projects that includes the motivation, methodological justification and details, descriptive data and deep learning modeling, interpretation of findings (e.g., discovered structures, predictions, generations), conclusion, and an annotated code appendix. These should not read like an academic paper, but a mixture of (1) explanatory tutorial; and (2) digital museum exhibit, balancing intermittent text with figures, description boxes, equations, and/or conceptual diagrams including at least one visual element (e.g., figure, graph, conceptual diagram) for every 300 words of text; and a minimum total of 5000 words and 17 visual elements; but 3600 words and 13 visual elements for single author projects. In short, they represent the methods section + operational tutorial of a (hopefully) awesome paper. These may include relevant code and should link to an open GitHub or Colab repository for code evaluation. **Posts are due Friday, Mar 14th @ 5pm.**

### Presentation

Groups will also present the motivation, process and findings from their projects the day before in slots log-proportional to the size of the team:

| Team Size | Time | Slides |
|-----------|------|--------|
| 1 person  | 5 minutes | 20 slides |
| 2 people  | 6.5 minutes | 26 slides |
| 3 people  | 7.5 minutes | 30 slides |
| 4 people  | 8 minutes | 32 slides |
| 5 people  | 8.5 minutes | 34 slides |

Presentations are online Ignite style talks on **Wednesday, Mar 11th from 5:00pm**. Students will submit (1) final presentation slides by **Wednesday, Mar 11 @ 3:00pm** (sign up for presentations here).

> † Students with data connected to a personal project (e.g., related to a thesis or dissertation) may work on projects alone or in smaller groups with instructor authorization.
